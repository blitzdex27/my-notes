# Best practices

> `img` element should always have `alt` attribute.

- `alt` attribute is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load

> set a `for` attribute on `label` element, with a value that matches the `id` attribute of the `input` element.

- This allows assistive technologies to create a linked relationship between the label and the related input element.

> end inline `style` declarations with a `;`

> `id` attributes should be unique.

> no matter the position of elements, the underlying HTML markup should be organized and make sense when read from top to bottom. This is how users with visual impairments (who rely on assistive devices like screen readers) access your content.
