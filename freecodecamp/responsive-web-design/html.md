# HTML

## HTML Elements

### Descriptive tags

Gives descriptive structure and help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility.

> `main`, `header`, `footer`, `nav`, `video`, `article`, `section`, etc

For example, `main` HTML5 tag helps search engines and other developers find the main content of your page.

### `<img src="#" alt="an image">

`img` elements are self-closing, and should always have `alt` attribute. `alt` attribute is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load. Except if the image is purely decorative, using empty `alt` attribute is a best practice.
