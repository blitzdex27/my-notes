## Basics

- Data types (int, float, char, etc.)
- Conditions (statements and expressions)
  - if - else if - else (statement)
  - condition ? value if true : value if false (expression)
- Functions (function - method - block)
  - `functions` are created globally, and is used to perform specific operation/purpose
  - `methods` are functions created inside a class (instance or class method)
  - `block` are functions that can be created anywhere
- Define
  - replaces code (copy - paste)
  - can act like a function
- enum (enumerated type)
  - basically, it contains a word that has equivalent integer value
  - used to prevents confusion by using words instead of just numbers
  - i also call it "expressed numbers"

## Objective-C classes

- Creating a class
- NSString, NSNumber, NSArray, NSDictionary
- Class category
- Class extension
- Class protocols

## Data Structures

A specialized means of arranging data, so it can be accessed efficiently.
