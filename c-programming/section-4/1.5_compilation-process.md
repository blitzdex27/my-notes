# compilation process

- preprocessing (preprocessing tool)
    - converts `.c` into intermediate file `.i`
    - comments removal (//)
    - macros expansion (#define)
    - file inclusion (#include)
    - conditional compilation (#ifdef, #endif, #ifndef, #if, #else, #elif)
- compiling
    - converts intermediate code `.i` into assembly level instructions(low level code)`.s`
    - checks for syntax errors and warnings
- assembling (assembler)
    - converts from `.s` into machine readable code `.o` or `.obj`
- linking
    - inclusion of library files `.lib` into program
    - creates an executable file `.exe` and `.out`
