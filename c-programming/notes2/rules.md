# Group

## Rules

1. Help each other
   A good training group is where trainees revolve roles between student and teacher

   - when a student doesn’t understand something, they work to learn
   - when a student gets something better than everyone else, they teach what they know
   - both teaching and learning are beneficial on learning the subject better

2. Keep up
   We all struggle to learn things at times.
   - if you're struggling because you've studied hard and can't figure it out, we would love to help
   - if you're struggling because you haven't searching the web, or done some practice, that shouldn't be our problem
3. Share resources
   Sharing what you have is a good way to keep improving yourself. (i.e. you share something good, and it made them catch up to you faster. this will push you to move forward and improve)

   - share notes
   - share tutorials you find worth taking
   - share things you think might help

4. Share ideas
   Everyone have different perspective on things, so ideas might differ

   - don't be afraid to share your ideas, but
   - be mindful with your words so as to not offend people

5. Friendly competition is good
   A competitive drive is a fuel to keep us all going

   - this may look like competition against each other, but
   - that's just to keep us motivated
   - the real competition is with ourselves.

6. Don't Be A Prick
   Everyone is going to have their own "stupid moments"
   - it's okay to have fun with other people and make jokes, but
   - if they’re not getting enjoyment out of it then you’re being a Prick

## Important reminders:

- Sharing knowledge, ideas, and resources are good, but refrain from pushing them too much onto others. It is always up to them to take.
- When you are teaching, don't start with the shortcut. People learn faster when they understand what they are doing. Start with the basic concept first, before proceeding with alternatives.

## Always remember:

You can be better.

You are capable of extraordinary things.

The hardest part is figuring out what you need to do.

Once you get on the right path, it just gets easier from there.
