# Lesson 1

## Topics

- overview of C - efficient, portable, power and flexibility, programmer oriented
- language features - imperative language, top-down planning, structured programming and modular design
  - imperative language - uses a sequence of statements to determine how to reach a certain goal. these statements are said to change the state of the program as each one is executed in turn
  - top-down planning - involves defining organizational goals on a high level and breaking them down into specific objectives which are then addressed in phases
  - structured programming - known as modular programming, a programming paradigm that facilitates the creation of programs iwth readable code and reusable components
- advantages of using C
- how to use a modern, cross-platform Integrated Development Environment (Microsoft Visual Studio Code) to write, edit, and debug your C code
- Basic C concepts - structore of a program, comments, output using printf
- makefiles - how to build
- Variables - declaring and using
- data types - int, float, double, char, etc (as well as enums and type definitions)
- Basic operators - logical, arithmetic and assignment
- conditional statements - making decisions (if, switch)
- Repeating code - looping (for, while, and do-while)
- Arrays - defining and initializing, multi-dimensional
- Functions - declaration and use, arguments and parameters, call by value vs. call by reference
- Debugging - call stack, common mistakes, understanding compiler messages
- Structs - initializing, nested structures, variants
- Character Strings - basics, arrays of chars, character operations
- Pointers - definition and use, using with functions and arrays, malloc, pointer arithmetic
- The preprocessor - #deefine, #include
- Input and Output - getchar, scanf
- File Input/Output - reading and writing to a file, file operations
- Standard C Library - string functions, math functions, utility functions, standard header files

## Writing a program

The act of writing a C program can be broken down into multiple steps

1. define the program objectives

- understand the requirements of the program
- get a clear idea of what you want the program to accomplish

2. design the program

- decide how the program will meet the above requirements
- what should the user interface be like?
- how should the program be organized?

3. write the code

- start implementation, translate the design in the syntax of C
- you need to use a text editor to create what is called a source code file

4. compile

- translate the source code into machine code (executable code)
- consists of detailed instructions to the CPU expressed in a numeric code

5. run the program

- the executable file is a program you can run

6. test and debug the program

- just because a program is running, does not mean it works as intended
- need to test, to see that your program does what it is supposed to do (may find bugs)
  - debugging is t he process of finding and fixing program errors
  - making mistakes is a natural part of learning

7. maintain and modify the program
