## Writing a program

The act of writing a C program can be broken down into multiple steps

1. define the program objectives

- understand the requirements of the program
- get a clear idea of what you want the program to accomplish

2. design the program

- decide how the program will meet the above requirements
- what should the user interface be like?
- how should the program be organized?

3. write the code

- start implementation, translate the design in the syntax of C
- you need to use a text editor to create what is called a source code file

4. compile

- translate the source code into machine code (executable code)
- consists of detailed instructions to the CPU expressed in a numeric code

5. run the program

- the executable file is a program you can run

6. test and debug the program

- just because a program is running, does not mean it works as intended
- need to test, to see that your program does what it is supposed to do (may find bugs)
  - debugging is t he process of finding and fixing program errors
  - making mistakes is a natural part of learning

7. maintain and modify the program

- program are released and used by many people
- have to continue to fix new bugs or add new features

TIP 1: do not skip steps
TIP 2: divide and conquer
