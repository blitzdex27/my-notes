## Language features

- C produces compact and efficient programs
- C is one of the most important programming languages and will continue to be so
- the main features of C are the following
  - efficient
  - portable
  - powerful and flexible
  - programmer oriented

### Efficiency and Portability

- C is an efficient language

  - takes advantage of the capabilities of current computers
  - C programs are compact and fast (similar to assembly language programs)
  - programmers can fine-tune their programs for maximum speed or most efficient use of memory

- C is a portable language

  - C programs written on one system can be run on other systems with little or no modification
  - a leader in portability
  - compilers are available for many computer architectures

- Linux/Unix systems typically come with a C compiler as part of the package
  - compilers are available for personal computers
- a good chance that you can get a C compiler for whatever device you are using

### Power and Flexibility

- the Unix/Linux kernal is written in C
- many compilers and interpreters for other languages (FORTRAN, Perl, Python, Pascal, LISP, Logo, and BASIC) have been written in C
- C programs have been used for solving physics and engineering problems and even for animating special effects for movies
- C is flexible
  - used for developing just about everything you can imagine by way of a computer program
  - accounting applications to word processing and from games to operating systems
  - it is the basis for more advanced languages, such as C++
- it is also used for developing mobile phone apps in the form of Objective C
- C is easy to learn because of its compactness
  - is an ideal first language to learn if you want to be a programmer
  - you will acquire sufficient knowledge for practical application development quickly and easily

### Programmer Oriented

- C fulfills the needs of programmers

  - gives you access to hardware
  - enables you to manipulate individual bits in memory

- C contains a large selection of operators which allows you to express yourself succinctly

- C is less strict than most languages in limiting what you can do
  - can be both an advantage and a danger
    - advantage is that many tasks (such as converting forms of data) are easier in C
    - danger is that you can make mistakes (pointers) that are impossible in some languages
    - C gives you more freedom, but it also puts more responsibility on you
- C implementations have a large library of useful C functions
  - deal with common needs of most programmers

### Other Features

- provides low level features that are generally provided by the Lower level languages
- programs can be manipulated using bits

  - ability manage memory representation at bitt level
  - provides wide variety of bit manipulation operators

- pointers play a big role in C
  - direct access to memory
  - supports efficient use of pointers

### Disadvantages

- Flexibility and freedom also requires added responsibility

  - use of pointers is problematic and abused
  - you can make programming errors that are difficult to trace

- Sometimes because of its wealth of operators and its conciseness, it makes the language difficult to read and follow
  - there is an opportunity to write obscure code

### Summary

C language features

- fast and efficient
- portable
- function rich libraries
- modularity
- easy to extend
- variety of data types and powerful operators
