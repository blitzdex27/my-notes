## Overview

C is a generald-purpose, imperative computer programming language that supports structured programming

- uses statements that change a program's state, focuses on how

Currently, it is one of the most widely used programming language of all time

C is a modern language

- has most basic control structures and features of modern languages
- designed for top-down planning
- organized around the use of functions (modular design) structured programming
- a very reliable and readable program

C is used on everything from minicomputers, Unix/Linux system to pc's and mainframes

C is the preferreed language for producing word processing programs, spreadsheets and compilers

C has become popular for programming embedded systems

- used to program microprocessors found in automobiles, cameras, DVD players, etc.

C has and continues to play a strong role in the development of Linux

C programs are easy t o modify and easy to adapt to new models or languages

In the 1990s, many software houses began turning to the C++ language for large programming projects

C is a subset of C++ with object-oriented programming tools added

- any C program is a valid C++ program
- by learning C, you also learn much of C++

C remains a core skill needed by corporations and ranks in the top 10 of desired skills

C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions andthus is used by programs that were previously implement in assembly language

- provides low-level access to memory (has many low-level capabilities)
- requires minimal run-time support

C was invented in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie of Bell Laboratories

- Ritchie was working on the design of the UNIX operating System

C was created as a tool for working programmers

- main goal is to be useful language
- easy readability and writability

C initially became widely known as the development language of the UNIX operating system

- virtually all new major operating systems are written in C and/or C++

C evolved from a previous programming language named B

- uses many of the important concepts of B while adding data typing and other powerful features
- B was a "typeless" language -- every data item occupied one "word" in memory, and the burden of typing variables fell on the shoulders of the programmer

C is available for most computers

C is also hardware independent

### Standard

By the late 1970s, C had evolved into what is now referred to as "traditional C"

The rapid expansion of C working on many different hardware platforms led to many variations that were similar but often incompatible

- a standard version of C was created (C89/C90, C99, C11)

A program written only in Standard C and without any hardware-dependent assumptions will run correctly on any platform with a standard C compiler

- non-standard C programs may run only on a certain platform or with a particular compiler

C89 is supported by current C compilers

- most C code being written today is based on it

C99 is revised standard for the C programming language that refines and expands the capabilities of C

- has not been widely adopted and not all popular C compilers support it

the current standard is commonly referred to as C11
- some elements of the language as defined by C11 are optional
- also possible that a C11 compiler may not implement all of the language features mandataed by the C11 standard
- these notes will base its examples and concepts off C11

C is one of the most important and popular programming languages

It has grown because people try it and like it

In the past decade or two, many have moved from C to languages such as C++, Objective C, and Java
- C is still an important language in its own right, as well a migration path to these others
